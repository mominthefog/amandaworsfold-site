        <!-- The Problem -->
        <section class="content-section">
            <div class="container-narrow">
                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <p>You know AI can help your business. But your data is everywhere—Google Drive, email, Notion, spreadsheets, your head—and you don't know where to start.</p>
                <p>You've maybe played with ChatGPT. It's cool, but it doesn't know <em>your</em> business. It can't answer:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"What's our policy on X?"</li>
                    <li>"What did we do for that client last year?"</li>
                    <li>"Summarize the key themes from our last 10 member calls"</li>
                    <li>"Draft a response based on how we usually handle this"</li>
                </ul>
                <p>So you're still the bottleneck. Still digging through folders. Still answering the same questions. Still recreating things you know you've written before.</p>
                <p><strong>And every time you bring on help—a contractor, a fractional hire, a new team member—you spend hours getting them up to speed.</strong> You're the walking FAQ. The human search engine. The single point of failure.</p>
                <p>You can't scale this way. And you can't take a vacation.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <!-- The Solution -->
        <section class="content-section">
            <div class="container-narrow">
                <h2>The Solution</h2>
                <p>The Knowledge Build is a 4-8 week engagement where I turn your messy, scattered knowledge into an AI-powered interface you can actually use.</p>
                <p>By the end, you can:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ask questions and get real answers</strong> — "What do we know about X?" pulls from your actual docs, not the internet</li>
                    <li><strong>Draft in your voice instantly</strong> — Proposals, emails, member communications based on how you've written before</li>
                    <li><strong>Stop repeating yourself</strong> — Onboarding docs, FAQs, policies become self-serve</li>
                    <li><strong>Find anything in seconds</strong> — No more digging through 47 folders and 3 inboxes</li>
                    <li><strong>Onboard anyone in minutes</strong> — Contractors, fractional hires, new team members query the business instead of interrupting you</li>
                    <li><strong>Finally take that vacation</strong> — The knowledge lives in the system, not just your head</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>You get hours back every week.</strong> You stop being the bottleneck. You delay (or avoid) hiring for work AI can now do.</p>

                <h2>Who It's For</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Solopreneurs</strong> drowning in scattered docs, answering the same questions, recreating work you've already done</li>
                    <li><strong>Small business owners</strong> who want AI to help but don't know where to start—and can't afford to hire yet</li>
                    <li><strong>Startups and growing companies</strong> moving too fast to document, onboarding new people constantly, with knowledge trapped in the founders' heads</li>
                    <li><strong>Companies using fractional talent</strong> tired of losing weeks to onboarding every new contractor or part-time exec</li>
                    <li><strong>Community founders</strong> sitting on valuable IP trapped in your head or buried in content</li>
                    <li><strong>Trade associations and membership orgs</strong> with member data, policies, and institutional knowledge scattered everywhere</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Common thread:</strong> You're too busy running the business to organize the business. And you know there's gold in your data if you could just access it.</p>
