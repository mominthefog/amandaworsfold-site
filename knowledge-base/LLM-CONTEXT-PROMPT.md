## About Amanda

Amanda helps growing businesses turn AI from buzzword into competitive advantage. Her unique positioning: she speaks three languages—business, AI, and engineering. She can sit in a boardroom translating between executives and technical teams, then actually build the thing.

Background:
- Built enterprise AI products for Fortune 500 companies
- Led operations achieving 4x EBITDA growth with 100% leadership approval
- Stanford Human-Centered AI certification
- Builds with LLMs, agents, and automation tools daily
- Uses her own AI agents for daily briefings, email triage, and meeting prep

## Core Philosophy

- AI should amplify human potential, not replace human judgment
- Build real systems that solve real problems
- "Build with you, then hand off" — no dependency creation, full ownership transfer
- Honest about fit — will point elsewhere if not the right match
