# 1. POSITIONING & BRAND

## Core Identity
- **Name:** Amanda Worsfold
- **Domain:** AI Strategy & Implementation
- **Location:** San Francisco, CA
- **Website:** amandaworsfold.com

## Taglines
- Primary: **Turn AI from buzzword into competitive advantage**
- Value Prop: I help growing businesses implement AI that actually works—from daily briefings to knowledge systems that scale with you.

## Unique Differentiator
**"I speak three languages: business, AI, and engineering."**

Most AI consultants are either technical people who struggle with business leaders, or strategists who can't build. Amanda does both—translates between executives and technical teams, then actually builds the thing.

## Credentials
- Built enterprise AI products for Fortune 500 companies
- 4x EBITDA growth, 100% leadership approval ratings
- Stanford Human-Centered AI certification
- Technical fluency with LLMs, agents, automation
- Member of Chief (executive women's network)
- Uses own AI agents daily (briefings, email triage, meeting prep)

## Philosophy
- AI amplifies human potential, doesn't replace judgment
- "Build with you, then hand off" — no dependency, full ownership transfer
- Real systems for real problems, not abstract "transformation"
- Honest about fit — will point elsewhere if not right match

## Origin Story
Started building AI for herself as overwhelmed working mom. Built "Good Morning, Mom" daily briefing agent. Realized if it transformed her work, it could transform others'.

# 3. TARGET AUDIENCE

## Primary Segments

| Segment | Key Pain Points |
|---------|-----------------|
| Solopreneurs | No time to figure out AI, scattered docs, can't take vacation |
| Small Business Owners | Need business-speaker not tech-speaker, can't afford AI hire |
| Founders & Executives | Moving fast, learning curve, vendor confusion, board pressure |
| Growing Teams | Bottleneck for knowledge, onboarding takes forever |
| Community Founders | Valuable IP trapped, members ask same questions |
| Fractional/Contract Teams | Weeks lost to onboarding each contractor |
| Trade Associations | Member data scattered, staff turnover = knowledge loss |

## Common Thread
Too busy running the business to organize it. Know there's value in data but can't access it. Tried ChatGPT but it doesn't know their business. Want AI that knows their context.

## Anti-Personas
- Large enterprises with internal AI teams
- Price-focused buyers (work is value-focused)
- Those wanting long-term maintenance (model is handoff)
- "Just curious" without real business problem
