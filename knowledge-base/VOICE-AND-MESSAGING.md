# Amanda Worsfold — Brand Voice & Messaging Guide

## Voice Characteristics

### Tone
- **Confident but not arrogant** — Knows her stuff, doesn't need to prove it constantly
- **Direct and practical** — Gets to the point, no fluff
- **Warm and approachable** — Human, relatable, not corporate
- **Grounded in reality** — Uses real examples from own experience
- **Honest** — Will point elsewhere if not the right fit

### Language Style
- Conversational, not formal
- Uses contractions (I'm, you're, don't, can't)
- First and second person (I, you, we)
- Short sentences mixed with longer explanations
- Questions that reflect what the reader is thinking
- Concrete examples over abstract concepts

### What to Avoid
- Jargon without explanation
- Buzzwords (except to call them out)
- Corporate-speak
- Overpromising or hype
- Generic AI claims
- Positioning as the "only" or "best"

## Signature Phrases & Patterns

### Headlines & Taglines
- "Turn AI from buzzword into competitive advantage"
- "AI that actually works"
- "I speak three languages: business, AI, and engineering"
- "Build with you, then hand off"
- "Turn your scattered knowledge into something you can talk to"

### Problem Framing (Uses Direct Quotes)
The "Sound familiar?" pattern with quote marks:
- "I know AI can help, but I don't know where to start"
- "I've tried ChatGPT but it doesn't know my business"
- "I'm spending hours on tasks AI should handle"
- "My knowledge is scattered everywhere"
- "I want AI that sounds like me, not like a robot"
- "I need help but can't afford a full-time hire"

### Outcome Framing
Before/After contrast:
- "I know I wrote that somewhere..." → Found it in 5 seconds
- "Onboarding a contractor = 5 hours of calls" → "Here's the chat, ask it anything"
- "Can't take a vacation" → "The knowledge lives in the system"

### Service Descriptions
Practical, outcome-focused:
- "Wake up to a daily email that knows your calendar, inbox, and priorities"
- "An AI agent trained on your content that writes like you—not like everyone else"
- "I'm yours for the day. We knock out whatever you need."

### CTAs
Low-pressure, conversational:
- "Let's have a conversation about what's possible"
- "Book a call" (not "Schedule a consultation")
- "That's what the call is for" (acknowledges uncertainty)
- "Even if that means pointing you somewhere else" (honesty about fit)

## Messaging by Context

### For Skeptics
Acknowledge the skepticism, then prove with specifics:
- "I don't sell 'AI transformation' in the abstract. I build real systems that solve real problems."
- "I've built these systems for myself... I know what works because I use it every day."

### For Overwhelmed Prospects
Meet them where they are:
- "You know AI can help your business. But your data is everywhere... and you don't know where to start."
- "You're too busy running the business to organize the business."

### For Enterprise/Leadership
Speak to strategic concerns:
- "Your team is drowning in AI noise—vendor pitches, breathless headlines, random experiments."
- "I cut through it by showing what actually works."

### For Price-Sensitive Prospects
Frame value, not cost:
- "You get hours back every week."
- "You stop being the bottleneck."
- "You delay (or avoid) hiring for work AI can now do."
