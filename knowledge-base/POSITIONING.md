## Core Identity

**Domain:** AI Strategy & Implementation

## Tagline & Value Proposition

**Primary Tagline:**
> Turn AI from buzzword into competitive advantage

**Core Value Proposition:**
I help growing businesses implement AI that actually works—from daily briefings to knowledge systems that scale with you.

## Unique Positioning

**The Three Languages:**
I speak three languages: business, AI, and engineering.

**The Differentiator:**
Most AI consultants are either technical people who struggle to connect with business leaders, or strategists who can't actually build anything. I'm neither. I can sit in a boardroom and translate between executives and technical teams—then actually build the thing.

**Proof Point:**
I've built these systems for myself. My own AI agents handle my daily briefings, my email triage, my meeting prep. I know what works because I use it every day.

- Led operations that achieved 4x EBITDA growth with 100% leadership approval ratings
- Stanford Human-Centered AI certification
- Technical fluency—builds with LLMs, agents, and automation tools daily
- Member of Chief (executive network for senior women leaders)

## Core Philosophy

**On AI's Role:**
AI should amplify human potential, not replace human judgment.

**On Consulting Approach:**
I don't sell "AI transformation" in the abstract. I build real systems that solve real problems—and I make sure you can maintain them without me.

**The Guiding Principle:**
*Build with you, then hand off.*

You're not hiring a consultant who creates dependency. You're hiring a partner who transfers capability. When we're done, you own the system, understand how it works, and can evolve it as your business grows.

## Origin Story

Started building AI systems for myself—not to start a business, but out of being overwhelmed. As a working mom running multiple projects, was drowning in information: meeting notes scattered across apps, important emails buried, knowledge trapped in the head.

Built the "Good Morning, Mom" daily briefing agent that reads emails, checks calendar, pulls from task lists. Then built more: agents that draft in my voice, systems that organize knowledge, workflows that do repetitive work.

**The realization:** If this transformed my own work, it could transform others' too.
