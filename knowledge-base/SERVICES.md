| 4. Build | Create chat interface using the right tool for the setup |
| 5. Handoff | Training to use, maintain, and expand it independently |

- Preps meeting agendas based on past discussions
- Onboards new clients with personalized welcome sequences
- Generates reports from data on a schedule

## Speaking & Workshops

### Executive AI Briefing
**Duration:** 90 minutes

**Outcomes:**
