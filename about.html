                        <p>Most AI consultants are either technical people who struggle to connect with business leaders, or strategists who can't actually build anything. I'm neither.</p>
                        <p>I can sit in a boardroom and translate between executives and technical teams—then actually build the thing.</p>

                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>I've spent my career at the intersection of strategy and execution:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Built enterprise AI products</strong> — I've designed and shipped AI-powered systems used by Fortune 500 companies</li>
                    <li><strong>Led operations that delivered results</strong> — 4x EBITDA growth with 100% leadership approval ratings</li>
                    <li><strong>Stanford Human-Centered AI certification</strong> — Deep training in responsible, effective AI implementation</li>
                    <li><strong>Technical fluency</strong> — I build with LLMs, agents, and automation tools daily</li>
                </ul>
                <p>But credentials only tell part of the story.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <!-- The Real Story -->
        <section class="content-section">
            <div class="container-narrow">
                <h2>Why I Do This Work</h2>
                <p>I started building AI systems for myself. Not because I was trying to start a business—because I was overwhelmed.</p>
                <p>As a working mom running multiple projects, I was drowning in information. Meeting notes scattered across apps. Important emails buried in my inbox. Knowledge trapped in my head that I couldn't easily share with collaborators.</p>
                <p>So I built something. A daily briefing agent that reads my emails, checks my calendar, pulls from my task lists, and sends me a "Good Morning, Mom" summary every day at 6am. It tells me what's urgent, what I'm forgetting, and what my kids have going on.</p>
                <p>Then I built more. Agents that draft in my voice. Systems that organize my knowledge so I can actually find things. Workflows that do the repetitive work so I can focus on what matters.</p>
                <p><strong>And I realized: if this transformed my own work, it could transform others' too.</strong></p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <!-- My Approach -->
        <section class="content-section">
            <div class="container-narrow">
                <h2>My Approach</h2>
                <p>I believe AI should amplify human potential, not replace human judgment.</p>
                <p>That means I don't sell "AI transformation" in the abstract. I build real systems that solve real problems—and I make sure you can maintain them without me.</p>
                <p>My work follows a simple principle: <strong>Build with you, then hand off.</strong></p>
                <p>You're not hiring a consultant who creates dependency. You're hiring a partner who transfers capability. When we're done, you own the system, understand how it works, and can evolve it as your business grows.</p>

        <!-- Beyond Work -->
        <section class="content-section">
            <div class="container-narrow">
                <h2>Beyond Work</h2>
                <p>I live in San Francisco with my husband and two kids. When I'm not building AI systems, you'll find me volunteering at my kids' school, experimenting with new tools, or trying to convince my family that the robot vacuum is not, in fact, plotting against us.</p>
                <p>I'm a member of Chief, an executive network for senior women leaders, and active in several AI and technology communities.</p>
