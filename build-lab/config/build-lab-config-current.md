## Landing Page Content

### Hero
- **Headline:** Your team's knowledge is scattered across 47 documents, 12 Slack threads, and someone's head.
- **Subhead:** Build an AI knowledge partner that actually keeps up with your team. Join this free hands-on session and walk away with a working system.

### What You'll Learn
- Set up a shared AI workspace your whole team can access
- Create "key context" documents that keep your AI informed without extra work
- Use AI for team coordination, not just individual productivity
- Build something you can actually use on Monday

### Who This Is For
- Team leads and managers coordinating distributed or async teams
- Founders and executives who want AI that serves the whole team, not just themselves
- Corporate teams working in Google Workspace who want to leverage Gemini
- Consultants who work with client teams and want a repeatable approach
- Anyone tired of knowledge living in one person's head

### What We'll Build
I'll walk through a real case study: "Delphine," a custom AI knowledge partner I built for a 10-person distributed startup team.

The team was tackling an ambitious problem with members distributed across time zones, each contributing 5-7 hours weekly. Knowledge was fragmenting across individual work sessions. Meeting notes lived in scattered documents. The project manager was spending disproportionate time synthesizing updates.

We built a custom GPT that became the team's strategic advisor and knowledge hub. Within weeks, the project manager described a "much lower touch" approach to monitoring progress. Team members began learning from each other's AI conversations. One team member captured it simply: "It's getting really fun to work with Delphine."

Then I'll show you how to build your own version, step by step. I'll demo approaches that work in Claude, ChatGPT, and Google Workspace with Gemini, so you can use whatever your team already has access to.

### Key Results/Proof Points
- Project manager went from chasing updates to asking the AI what happened that week
- Team members started learning from each other's AI conversations
- New documents got drafted in minutes instead of hours because the AI already knew the context
